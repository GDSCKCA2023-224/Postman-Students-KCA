# DISCLAIMER!!
As I put together [this site](https://gdsckca2023-224.github.io/Postman-Students-KCA/), I did it as just a resource site, to have a 'one-stop shop' for all resources to learn the API Lifecycle with Postman. 

As the project grows and becomes more than just a resource site, I will change the project from a basic HTML + CSS + JS page to a [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) & [Golang](https://encore.dev/docs/go) stack in release-v2.0.0 in the foreseeable future
